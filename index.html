  <h1> 1  Anonymous </h1>
  <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;">Anonymous is an international group of hacktivists and activists. It was originated in 2003 and involved in many illegal activities. They attacked several governments, corporate and religious websites. This group protests against the restriction of providing free stuff on the internet. In 2012, Time Magazine placed them in the list of 100 most influential people in the world. Since 2003, dozens of people have been arrested for involvement in the group in many countries including the UK, US, and Australia. 
  dis. Enim tortor at auctor urna nunc id cursus metus.he name Anonymous itself is inspired by the perceived anonymity under which users post images and comments on the Internet. Usage of the term Anonymous in the sense of a shared identity began on imageboards, particularly the /b/ board of 4chan, dedicated to random content and to raiding other websites.[32] A tag of Anonymous is assigned to visitors who leave comments without identifying the originator of the posted content. Users of imageboards sometimes jokingly acted as if Anonymous was a single individual.<br>
